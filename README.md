This is "Game of life". It's not a game but rather a 'cellular automaton', and was invented by 
Cambridge mathematician John Conway.

This game, or maybe rahter "life" relays on 4 simple rules:

1. Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude

2. Each cell with two or three neighbors survives

3. Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation

4. Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated
